Version 1.1
-2017-10-31

- Fixed smartctl finding disk temp with 'Temperature' vs
  relying on finding field 194.  This can fix alot of
  issues if other numbers have 194 in them.
- Fixed an error where high_drive_temp not initialized
  to zero if MEGARAID is not set to 1.
- Fixed MEGACLI and MEGACLI conditions requiring 1 to be
  true versus just being set.
- Changed poll_drive_temp() to use MegaCLI regardless of
  MEGARAID setting, as long as MEGACLI=1.
- Add a user-configurable option to disable megacli
  detection (MEGACLI=0|1).
